<h2 align="center">MacPorts Webapp Project Report</h2>
<p align="center">GOOGLE SUMMER OF CODE 2019</p>

The MacPorts web application, which has been implemented during Google Summer of Code 2019:

1. Displays general information about all the ports.

2. Fetches and displays build-history of the ports.

3. Collects and displays installation statistics (system configurations and installed ports) from users who opt-in by installing the port mpstats.

4. Makes available all the collected data through API.

The application has been deployed at [ports.macports.org](https://ports.macports.org) and most of the code has been [merged](https://github.com/macports/macports-webapp). The app has a dedicated repository: [macports-webapp](https://github.com/macports/macports-webapp), and is written from scratch during the project.

### Work Done During GSoC:

* Almost 99% of the work done by me is contained in the dedicated [macports-webapp](https://github.com/macports/macports-webapp) repository which started from zero. It has been discussed in more detail in the next section.

* Work on [portindex2json.tcl](https://github.com/macports/macports-contrib/tree/master/portindex2json), improve its output to be fit for the webapp

    * [https://github.com/macports/macports-contrib/pull/2](https://github.com/macports/macports-contrib/pull/2)

    * [https://github.com/macports/macports-contrib/pull/3](https://github.com/macports/macports-contrib/pull/3)

    * [https://github.com/macports/macports-contrib/pull/5](https://github.com/macports/macports-contrib/pull/5)

* Minor changes to [mpstats](https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/tree/master/sysutils/mpstats), and add a new testing subport

    * [https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/pull/4521](https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/pull/4521)

* [mprsyncup](https://github.com/macports/macports-infrastructure/blob/master/jobs/mprsyncup) job, start generating portindex.json and distributing through rsync

    * [https://github.com/macports/macports-infrastructure/pull/10](https://github.com/macports/macports-infrastructure/pull/10)

    * [https://github.com/macports/macports-infrastructure/pull/12](https://github.com/macports/macports-infrastructure/pull/12)

### Live Pages from the App

* All pages of the website are responsive and work well on all screen sizes, including mobile phones.

### To do

Most of the planned features have been implemented in the app. But the app has great scope for addition of new features. Some improvements have also been suggested, thanks to the active MacPorts community.

**Higher priority:**

* Livecheck

* Enhanced searching: more filters and ranked search results

* Reliable submission of stats: try again if the command does not run within the week or fails

* Include port versions in build history
