Yes, I did consider writing this page in third person. But I wanted to talk with you, and me talking about myself with you in third person felt really very strange to me.

If it is not evident from every nook and corner of this website- my name is Arjun Salyan. If you are here to know stuff about me, may I request you to read this page in full?
<br><br>
I am an engineering student actively involved in web and mobile development (django, react, express) from a really really long time. As there is a famous terminology nowadays, I guess they call someone with these skillset, a full stack developer. Well, I don't find this term cool, it is even debatable as to what this term exactly means, or who would fall under this category. <br><br>
I do freelancing, I do open source, I do college projects, I intern with companies and I am hoping to get hired after college. My major at college is not computer science, yeah right, I am self taught in everything that is related to a computer. I have been doing this since secondary school. I also blog about the things I learn and which can be useful for others- that is one purpose- another is- sharing (just sharing).<br> <br>
Cloud is the new way to go forward, and recently (also luckily) I am moving from being a super-user of the cloud platforms to being given the opportunity of building one. I got the opportunity to be a part of the team that is building a next-gen cloud platform. I found this exciting and challenging- I learnt a great deal about networking and system design. Probably, I am liking it more becuase it is providing me a refreshing change? I don't know, because my love for building applications is only increasing- each day, day by day. But why? Why do I love building applications?<br><br>
Whatever I wrote above is a consequence of a feeling I carry with me- and that is- building products which can ease down a process or experience. This feeling is what drove me into this geeky stuff. There is a different kind of excitement in researching over the user needs, finding a solution and then implementing it. I wish I could emphasise it more. The last part, `implementation` drove me into learning to build my own tools- digital tools. If I try to find an analogy, then I can be compared to a cook who loves serving delicious but healthy food. And to achieve his idea of health- he starts to grow his own vegetables and spices. I am sorry if this sounds absurd, but in this paragraph I am simply writing as if we are having a conversation, as if I am telling you the basis of every single line of code I have written in my life, as if I am speaking my heart to you.
