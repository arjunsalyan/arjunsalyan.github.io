I would love to hear from you, be it a suggestion, feedback, query or criticism. I like the idea of having a discussion.

**To contact me, please use any, literally any page with comments, use my social handles or simply email me.**

Shall I also add a contact form on this page? I don't know, maybe it would be convenient, but sounds too formal.
